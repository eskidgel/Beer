As an avid beer drinker, I often find myself wanting to try many
different beers that I see at the liquor store. Due to lack of money and
room in my fridge, I leave with just a single 6-pack of a new beer that
I may or may not like. If only there was a way to purchase one pack of
beer that has multiple types of beer inside…

A variety pack of new, cool, and the best beers in the world!
