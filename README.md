**Introduction**

As an avid beer drinker, I often find myself wanting to try many different beers that I see at the liquor store. Due to lack of money and room in my fridge, I leave with just a single 6-pack of a new beer that I may or may not like. If only there was a way to purchase one pack of beer that has multiple types of beer inside...

A variety pack of new, cool, and the top rated craft beers in the world! 

This project objective is to

- simulate a variety pack to meet the needs of the consumer.
